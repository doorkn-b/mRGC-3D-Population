A 3D population model of midget retinal ganglion cells at the human fovea (Italiano et al, 2022)

A robust means of generating eccentricity-dependent and morphologically realistic and three-dimensional populations of midget retinal ganglion cells at the central human retina (specifically, at the (para-) foveal region).
